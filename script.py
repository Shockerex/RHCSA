This script uses the subprocess module to run the df -h command and capture its output. It then processes the output, skipping any lines that end with "tmpfs" (which are temporary files), and checking if any file systems have over 90% usage. If any do, it prints a message indicating which file system is over 90% used. Otherwise, it prints "OK".
